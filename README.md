## 🧠 About The Archive

Welcome to my training ground. This repository serves as a catalog of my cognitive evolution through programming. Here, I solve algorithmic challenges, dissect data structures, and refine my problem-solving efficiency using **Python**.

It's not just about getting the right answer; it's about finding the most elegant, efficient, and scalable path to the solution.

## 🗂️ Structure

The challenges are organized by complexity and source:

| Level | Description | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🟢 Easy** | Fundamental logic & syntax | Basic manipulation, Loops, Conditionals |
| **🟡 Medium** | Data Structures & Algorithms | Hash Maps, Pointers, Recursion |
| **🔴 Hard** | Complex Optimization | Dynamic Programming, Graphs, System Design |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Language:** Python 3.12+
* **Testing:** Pytest (TDD approach when applicable)
* **Analysis:** Big O Notation analysis in comments
* **Key Libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `math`

## 🚀 Recent Highlights

- [x] **[Name of a hard exercise you did]**: *Solved using [Specific Algorithm] to optimize time complexity to O(n).*
- [ ] **[Next Goal]**: *Mastering Binary Search Trees.*
